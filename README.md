# Landing Page Project

## Project Overview

This project involves manipulating the DOM to create an interactive landing page with a dynamic navigation bar that responds to section changes. The initial project provides HTML and CSS styling for a static landing page, and your task is to convert it into an interactive one using JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives

#### Through this project, we explored and implemented several key concepts:

- Event Listeners: Used to respond to user interactions, such as clicks and scrolls.
- Document Fragment: Employed to improve performance by minimizing DOM manipulation and reflow.
- Measuring Performance: Utilized performance.now() to measure the performance of critical operations.
- Scrolling: Implemented smooth scrolling functionality to navigate between sections seamlessly.
